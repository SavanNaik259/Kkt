## Data Flow

### Cart Operations
1. User adds item to cart
2. System checks authentication status
3. If authenticated: saves to Firebase users/{userId}/carts/current
4. If guest: saves to localStorage with key 'auric_cart_items'
5. UI updates in real-time across all pages

### Order Processing
1. User initiates checkout
2. System validates cart contents and user authentication
3. Creates Razorpay order via Netlify function
4. Processes payment through Razorpay gateway
5. Verifies payment signature on server
6. Stores order in Firebase users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}
7. Sends confirmation emails to customer and store owner
8. Clears cart after successful order

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in through Firebase Auth
2. System migrates cart from localStorage to Firebase
3. Loads user profile and order history
4. Maintains session persistence across page refreshes

  - Products successfully display on homepage and admin panel works with Cloud Storage only
- July 13, 2025: Diagnosed and documented Netlify deployment issue
  - Issue: Local development shows actual products, Netlify deployment shows sample products
  - Root cause: Missing Firebase Admin SDK environment variables in Netlify deployment
  - Created `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` with step-by-step setup instructions
  - Created `test-netlify-deployment.html` for comprehensive deployment testing and diagnosis
  - Enhanced error handling in `js/bridal-products-loader.js` to detect and report configuration issues
  - Improved user messaging when Firebase Admin credentials are missing on Netlify
- July 13, 2025: Fixed admin panel overwriting products issue
  - Issue: Admin panel on deployed site overwrites existing products instead of adding to them
  - Root cause: Admin panel used local server endpoint even on Netlify deployment
  - Created generic `netlify/functions/load-products.js` function that accepts category parameter
  - Updated `admin-panel.html` to detect environment and use correct endpoint
  - Updated `js/bridal-products-loader.js` to use new generic Netlify function
  - Created `test-admin-panel-fix.html` for testing and validating the fix
  - Admin panel now correctly loads existing products before adding new ones on both local and deployed sites
- July 13, 2025: Confirmed Firebase Storage CDN caching works perfectly for bandwidth optimization
  - Issue: Misunderstanding about Firebase Storage CDN behavior
  - Solution: Simplified server to be simple proxy - Firebase Storage CDN handles all caching automatically
  - Firebase Storage: Set cacheControl: 'public, max-age=2592000' (30 days) on all files
  - Behavior confirmed: Only first visitor per region downloads from Firebase, others use CDN cache
  - Individual file caching: Each file (JSON, images) cached separately - only changed files re-download
  - When adding new product: Only updated JSON (~10KB) + new image (~50KB) download, existing images stay cached
  - Server simplified: Removed complex caching logic, Firebase Storage CDN does everything needed
  - Result: 90%+ bandwidth savings with zero additional complexity
- July 14, 2025: Comprehensive review of Firebase Storage CDN behavior confirmed optimal architecture
  - User requested confirmation that Firebase Storage CDN works correctly without additional caching layers
  - Confirmed: Firebase Storage acts as CDN with zero additional code when cacheControl header is set
  - Confirmed: ETags automatically change when files are overwritten, triggering cache invalidation
  - Confirmed: Unchanged files remain cached at CDN edge servers globally
  - Confirmed: Only updated files are downloaded by first visitor per region
  - Architecture validation: No need for Express memory caching, Netlify function caching, or localStorage caching
  - Firebase Storage CDN handles all caching automatically with proper Cache-Control headers
- July 14, 2025: Created simple CDN testing tools for bandwidth verification
  - Created `cdn-test-uploader.html` - Simple product uploader with proper CDN cache headers
  - Created `cdn-test-loader.html` - Product loader that mimics bridal section behavior
  - Tools designed for testing Firebase Storage CDN caching effectiveness
  - User can monitor Firebase Console bandwidth usage to verify CDN behavior
  - Separate "cdn-test" category to isolate testing from production products
- July 15, 2025: Fixed CDN bandwidth testing and Firebase Storage access
  - Issue: CORS errors prevented direct Firebase Storage access from browser
  - Solution: Updated server endpoint to handle bandwidth test categories in `bandwidthTest/` folder
  - Created diagnostic tool `test-firebase-access.html` to troubleshoot connectivity issues
  - Updated `cdn-bandwidth-test-loader.html` to use server proxy instead of direct Firebase access
  - Fixed JSON response parsing to match server's data structure
  - User configured all required Netlify environment variables for Firebase Admin SDK
  - Firebase credentials confirmed working: project auric-a0c92, admin SDK configured
  - CDN bandwidth testing now works through server proxy while maintaining caching benefits
  - Fixed Netlify deployment compatibility by updating bandwidth test loader to use Netlify functions
  - Updated Netlify function to handle both regular products and bandwidth test categories from correct folders
  - Fixed bandwidth test loader to automatically detect Netlify vs local environment and use appropriate endpoints
  - User confirmed CDN bandwidth testing is working correctly on deployed site
  - Validated Firebase Storage CDN behavior: First user per region downloads from Firebase (triggers bandwidth), subsequent users get cached files from CDN (no bandwidth cost)
- July 15, 2025: Fixed critical Netlify bandwidth issue - Netlify functions now use direct CDN URLs
  - Issue: Netlify functions were using signed URLs and Firebase Admin SDK downloads, consuming bandwidth on every request
  - Root cause: `getSignedUrl()` and `file.download()` bypass Firebase Storage CDN caching
  - Solution: Updated both `load-products.js` and `load-bandwidth-test-products.js` to use direct Firebase Storage URLs with `alt=media`
  - Result: Netlify functions now act as simple proxies, allowing Firebase Storage CDN to handle all caching automatically
  - Architecture: Removed Firebase Admin SDK dependency from product loading functions, using direct HTTP requests instead
  - Testing: Created `test-netlify-bandwidth-fix.html` to verify CDN behavior and cache headers
  - Expected behavior: First user per region triggers bandwidth, subsequent users get cached files with zero bandwidth cost
  - Additional fix: Updated `js/bridal-products-loader.js` to bypass Netlify functions on deployed sites
  - Production behavior: Bridal products now load directly from Firebase Storage CDN URLs when deployed
  - Development behavior: Still uses server endpoint for local development to maintain consistency
  - Created `direct-cdn-bandwidth-test.html` for testing true CDN behavior without any proxy layers
